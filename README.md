# RED Talent Connect 2020

## Development

The files for the student overview website can be found in `client/`.

To get set up:

1. Make a copy of `client/.env.example` called `.env` in the same directory and fill it with your own LinkedIn email and password.
2. Install dependencies (`cd client && npm i`)
3. Start the dev server (`npm start`)

This site will ultimately be deployed as a static site. Run `npm run build` to build the site to `dist/`.

When working on a feature/fix, please discuss it in the [issues](https://github.com/shwilliam/red-talent-2020) to make sure you are the only one working on it. Feel free to open PRs early to ask for help/code review before you are ready to merge.
